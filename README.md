 ## Event driven framework for making games in Unity
 
 **!Warning!** Work in progress, this needs to be cleaned up first and made into a proper framework, but it is already usable.<br>
 
## What it is

A framework as a base for your unity game. This will let you make a clean and modular game without creating spaghetti code.<br>
The framework uses the unity event system, and lets your game objects and code communicate efficiently with events.<br>
Add the event system classes to an object in your first scene of the game, and they will run and stay alive, throughout scene/level changes.<br>
They manage **communication, scene changes, constants, states of the game, controls and storing progress or anything in cache.**<br>


## What the future holds

I want to add more and more basic functions, that are often used in games, as I develop them in the game that i am currently working on. Like movement, camera control, basic ai-npc behaviour, movement-trajectories...

## Setup

**This section will be added as soon as I have cleaned up the code**
